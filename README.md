Java Ray Tracer
===============
by Roger Allen

This is my implementation based on the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" e-book by Peter Shirley. http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html I wanted to implement this in Java as a way to become reaquainted with the language.

While developing, I looked at https://github.com/njeff/raytracer0/tree/master/weekend a few times.

On my machine this runs about 2-3x slower than the C++ Peter published at https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend  Not too bad for Java, I suppose.  I haven't used any profiling to speed it up yet.

I recommend you buy the e-book and implement this yourself. It was a lot of fun.
